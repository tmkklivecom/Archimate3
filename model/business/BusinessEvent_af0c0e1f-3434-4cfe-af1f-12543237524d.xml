    documentation="A Business Event is defined as something that happens (internally or externally) and influences behaviour (Business Process, Business Function, Business Interaction).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Business Processes and other business behaviour may be triggered or interrupted by a Business Event.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, Business Processes may raise events that trigger other Business Processes, Functions, or Interactions. A Business Event is most commonly used to model something that triggers behaviour.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unlike Business Processes, Functions, and Interactions, a Business Event is instantaneous: it does not have duration. A Business Event may have a time attribute that denotes the moment or moments at which the event happens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Events may originate from the environment of the organization (e.g., from a customer), but also internal events may occur generated by, for example, other processes within the organization.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Business Event may trigger or be triggered (raised) by a Business Process, Business Function, or Business Interaction.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A Business Event may access a Business Object and may be composed of other Business Events.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The name of a Business Event should preferably be a verb in the perfect tense; e.g., &quot;claim received&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Category:&#xD;&#xA;Business. Behavioural.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples:&#xD;&#xA;Claim Received, Application Form Received, Send Product Portfolio&#xD;&#xA;"/>
